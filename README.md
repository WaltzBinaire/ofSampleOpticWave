=================

This Code demonstrates a very basic conversion of optical flow to a waveform-like output. 
The idea was mentioned by Gabriel Shalom http://www.gabrielshalom.com/2014/01/the-motion-waveform/

It utilizes Kyle McDonald's ofxCV and of course OpenFrameworks. The Thing i added is a five liner...
and is simply for a communication purpose

This Code does not implement Gabriels vision, it is intended to demonstrate a very lightweight approach 
to transform one 2D image flow in two 1D Datasets.  *cough*
